# CONTEXT-BASED-IN-VIDEO-ADVERTISING

In this project we are analyzing a video and we are trying to find out the context from the video and based on the context we are giving ads suggestion.
This has many benefits first of all the ads which are given are based on the videos that the viewer is watching so we are increasing the chances that the user will watch that ad video.The most important factor is we are not storing any data of user which can be later missused. It is a very good way fro preserving cyber security.
